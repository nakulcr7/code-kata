    "** 1. The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an array of (left, right, height) tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of (x, height) tuples, giving the locations at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and each new height.**\n",
